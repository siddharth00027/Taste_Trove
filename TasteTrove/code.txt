crypto library is used to generate the random token for password reset

1)randomBytes(32,toS tring('hex'))=32 for no of characterand hex give in which form we want that token
2)we have to encrypt the token which can be done using crypto.createHash('algorithm type').update('string to be encrypt').digest('type of the hash')
we can use bcrypt but we dont need hash to be much sstrong
